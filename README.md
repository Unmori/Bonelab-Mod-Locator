# Bonelab-Mod-Locator
Bonelab Mod Locator is locating your mod folder to you choosing another directory. Including rollback backup, if locating is failed. It's works!

### How it works

This program uses symlink to create a directory shortcut to the internal folder of Bonelab mods. The program creates an intermediate backup of your mods and moves them to the directory of your choice.

Backup folder: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Temp\BonelabModsBackup

WARNING! Need execute with administrator rights!!!
